## Set up the local environment
### Option 1: Development with the Docker environment
This repository ships with a full docker based development environment that enables you to use all app functionality without much setup.

#### Requirements
* Internet Connection
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose)
* [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)

#### Setup
1. Checkout the project with `git clone git@github.com:marius-wieschollek/passwords.git`
2. Open the project directory in a terminal
3. Run `npm ci`
4. Run `npm run build`
5. If you have [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert), run `npm run mkcert`
6. Run `npm run start`
7. Open your browser and type [https://localhost/](https://localhost/)
8. Log in with the username `admin` and the password `admin`
9. You can now access the [app](http://localhost/index.php/apps/passwords)


### Option 2: Development with a Nextcloud Server
You can start development on the passwords app with your existing Nextcloud installation.

#### Requirements
* Internet Connection
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/)

#### Setup
1. Checkout the project with `git clone git@github.com:marius-wieschollek/passwords.git`
2. Symlink the /src folder to the /passwords folder in the Nextcloud apps directory
   or set up a file synchronisation between the folders.
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run build`
5. Open the apps store in your Nextcloud and enable the Passwords app


### Sample Data
The docker setup comes with two test users `max` and `erika` with the password `PasswordsApp`.
All users have a set of sample data installed.
You can also download a [file with sample data](https://git.mdns.eu/nextcloud/passwords/wikis/Developers/_files/SamplePasswords.json) from the wiki and can import it on the [backups page](http://localhost/index.php/apps/passwords#/backup).

### API Debugging
We offer a [postman collection](https://git.mdns.eu/nextcloud/passwords/-/wikis/Developers/_files/postman-collection.json) for the API debugging tool [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
